I thought it was a good time to start a blog about [WinUI3][winui-docs]. Doing so has been on my to-do list for a while and it's purely coincidence that today is also the day that **version 1.0.0** of [WindowsAppSDK][was-gh] is released.

I'm trying to document what I learn about Microsoft's latest technology for building Windows apps. I know blogging is "over" but creating TikTok's about it didn't seem like a good way to create something that others maybe able to find when they Google for issues or questions with the classes, APIs, and error messages.

[was-gh]: https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsAppSDK
